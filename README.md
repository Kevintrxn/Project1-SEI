# Project1-SEI
Project Name - Jumpy Dog 

****Background Info****

So for my first project, I decided to go with a more difficult challenge and code out a side-scroller. 
This game is dedicated to one of my pets that passed away a few months ago and simulates her being in
heaven collecting bones. 


**Concepts**

Dom Manipulation
Velocity 
Collision Detection
Object-Orientated Programming
Animation/Frame Management  
Method Chaining 
Image Handling 
 

**Languages Used:**

HTML
JavaScript
CSS


****Game Objectives**:
You are a dog sprite that spawns on a platform and there are randomly generated clouds with the occasional
bones that appear. The goal is to collect as many bones as possible without falling to the ground AKA the Y- axis.

**Game Movement**
Left/Right - A/D 
Jump       - W 

**Game Start**: 
Use the mouse to click the "Start Game" icon and you will spawn in the initial start screen.
